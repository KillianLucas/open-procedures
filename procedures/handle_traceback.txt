trigger phrases: "traceback", "error"

If you encounter a traceback, don't try to use an alternative method yet. Instead:

**Write a message to the user explaining what happened and theorizing why. Do not try to run_code immediatly after run_code has errored.**

If a solution is apparent (and is not simply changing methods / using a new package) attempt it.
If not, list these steps in a message to the user, then follow them one-by-one:

1. Create and run a minimal reproducible example.
2. Use dir() to verify correct imports. There may be a better object to import from the module.
3. Print docstrings of functions/classes using print(func.__doc__).

Only then are you permitted to use an alternative method.
