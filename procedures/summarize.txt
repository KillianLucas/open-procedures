trigger phrases: "summarize", "can you summarize this"

To summarize something, 99% OF THE TIME YOU CAN SIMPLY NOT WRITE CODE. Simply print/read the text then summarize it manually.

The vast majority of the time, that^ will be sufficient. ENSURE you can't read all the text at once before moving to the much more expensive languagetools options.

If the text is of tremendous length, like a book or unseeable by you when you print it (outputs are truncated to 2000 characters), run these commands:

```shell
pip install languagetools
```

```python
from languagetools import summarizer

summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
```
