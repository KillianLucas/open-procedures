To summarize something, USUALLY YOU CAN SIMPLY NOT WRITE CODE. Simply print/read the text then summarize it yourself.

1. Print the first 2000 characters of the document.
2. Manually write a summary for the printed chunk.
3. Print the next 2000 characters.
4. Write the following message AFTER the chunk is printed:
5. "Now I will manually write a new summary that builds on / refines my last summary with this new information. I will integrate both, but weigh this next summary towards my last summary (which contains more important/global/structural information than the current chunk)."
6. Repeat steps 3-5 (write that message EVERY time, after EVERY printed chunk) until the entire document is summarized.
