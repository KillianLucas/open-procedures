trigger phrases: "summarize", "can you summarize this"

To summarize something, USUALLY YOU CAN SIMPLY NOT WRITE CODE. Simply print/read the text then summarize it yourself.

# If it's likely long / of unknown length, like a PDF, run these commands:

```shell
pip install languagetools
```

```python
from languagetools import summarizer

summary = summarizer.summarize(text)
```
