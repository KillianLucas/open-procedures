trigger phrases: "can you make me a simple app", "write me a simple app", "simple app"

To make a simple app, use HTML/Bulma CSS/JS.
First, plan. Think deeply about the functionality, what the JS will need to do, and how it will need to work with the HTML.
Then, **all in one** `html` code block (DO NOT `run_code` more than once, and NEVER use placeholders like "// Javascript code here" -- you're going to write the HTML/JS in one `run_code` function call):
Put Bulma CSS and anything else you need in <head>, write the <body> of the app (add lots of padding on the body with Bulma), write the JS into the <script> tag.

You probably want to center the app in a box with a border and make sure the body fills up the whole height of the page!

Write **LOTS of <!--comments--> throughout the HTML and // Javascript** so the user knows what's going on, and use whitespace/indentation properly.

This will automatically open the HTML file / simple app on the user's machine.
