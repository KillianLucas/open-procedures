trigger phrases: "design me a website", "write HTML", "tailwind"

## Writing HTML
Unless otherwise specified, include Tailwind CSS IN EXACTLY THIS WAY: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` (with a SCRIPT tag to "https://cdn.tailwindcss.com") then style the HTML with inline Tailwind CSS classes.
Running `html` will automatically open it in the user's browser, you don't need to tell them to do that.
